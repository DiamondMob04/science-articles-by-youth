# science-articles-by-youth

This is a node.js application that I started during quarantine because I was getting bored and wanted to learn some web development. You can see the actual website <a href="http://www.sciencearticlesbyyouth.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you'd like to. This is in no means a professional application, and was generally created for me to understand the basics towards HTML, CSS, and client-side and server-side JS. This was created using various frameworks including Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Multer, Bcryptjs, JSONWebToken, etc.
